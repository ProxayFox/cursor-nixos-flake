  # Monitor Nix flake inputs
  # Note: Dependabot doesn't natively support Nix flakes.
  # Nix flake inputs (nixpkgs) are automatically updated via the
  # 'update-flake-inputs.yml' workflow which runs weekly and creates PRs.
  #
  # Cursor version updates are handled by the 'update-cursor.yml' workflow
  # which runs daily and automatically commits updates.
  #
  # Both workflows complement this Dependabot configuration to keep
  # all dependencies up to date.
  
  # If you add Docker or other dependencies in the future,
  # uncomment and configure as needed:
  # - package-ecosystem: "docker"
  #   directory: "/"
  #   schedule:
  #     interval: "weekly"
  #   open-pull-requests-limit: 5
  #   labels:
  #     - "dependencies"
  #     - "docker"
